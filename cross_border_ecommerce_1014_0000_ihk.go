/*
To add a new subcommand, you would typically create a new file in the cmd package,
define the command, and then add it to the rootCmd in this file.
For example, to add a product command, you would create cmd/product.go,
define the productCmd, and add it to the rootCmd like so:

var productCmd = &cobra.Command{
    Use:   "product",
    Short: "Manage products",
    Long:  "Manage products in the cross border e-commerce platform",
    Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
        // Your logic here
    },
}

func init() {
    rootCmd.AddCommand(productCmd)
}
